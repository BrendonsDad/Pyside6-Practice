# Pyside6-Practice
This is practice for me running Pyside6. Let's make some UIs!


- PySide Widgets for Beginners: Build Cross Platform Desktop apps with Qt

- Python + Qt = Robust GUIs for Windows, Linux and Mac

- Requirements
    - Basic Pyton and OOP
    - Strong Drive and Willingness to learn

- What you get:
    - A strong foundation for GUIs using Pyside6
    - Building GUIs for your Python projects
    - Transferable knowledge for other toolkits like PyQt
